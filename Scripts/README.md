# Optional Scripts
- Create Indices
- Event Scipts

## Create Indices
- Execute [script](create_indices_pokemon_history.sql) for faster execution of [nestwatcher](https://github.com/M4d40/nestwatcher) with `custom_pokemon_table=pokemon_history`

## Event Scripts - Use those SQL scripts carefully
Clearing for pokemon and incident is now happening in RDM application itself, no need for a separate database event anymore.  
Only use events for database tables if you know what you are doing.

**Always read announcements in Discord Server or Release description. Some code changes can affect the database events (like the introduction of the In-App Clearer for Pokemon/Incidents).**
