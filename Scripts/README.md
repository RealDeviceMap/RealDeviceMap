**Use those scripts carefully**

Clearing for pokemon and incident is now happening in RDM application itself, no need for a separate database event anymore.

Only use events for database tables if you know what you are doing.

**Always read announcements in Discord Server or Release description. Some code changes can affect the database events (like the introduction of the In-App Clearer for Pokemon/Incidents).**
